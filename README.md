## Reflection on Essential Questions

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  
I start by talking with users or stakeholders to uncover their goals and pain points. Then I write user stories (e.g. “As a user, I want to save my progress so I can pick up where I left off”) to break those needs into small, testable pieces. User stories help me stay focused on delivering real value and guide my planning and acceptance criteria.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
I develop in short iterations, building the simplest thing that could work and then refining it based on feedback. I plan to keep using sprint planning to choose the most important work, daily stand-ups to stay aligned with teammates, and regular retrospectives to continuously improve our process.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, helping others solve blockers, and taking ownership of your tasks. It also means listening to feedback, sharing knowledge freely, and pitching in wherever the team needs support—even outside your formal role.
